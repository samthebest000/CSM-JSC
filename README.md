# CSMYBA

The CSM Journalism Assistant Application

## Introduction

This is a project I am working on for my school called Classical School of the Medes.
I'm not doing this for grades, it is simply a project I started because I realised every good school has some sort of yearbook student coverage assistant, or something like that, and I also thought it would be fun.

The main feature of this app, will be the student coverage, which is a document that guides the designers and photgraphers to include as much people as possible into the yearbook.

if you have any tips for these kinds of things feel free to leave a comment or email me: samoaprem60@gmail.com

## Tools used

I will use the flutter framework, as it basically works on everything, IOS, Android, and most importantly, web, which is what shall be mainly used.
The reason I don't use the desktop feature is because not many things support desktop, plus, I am planning on alieviating as much load as possible on the client since we will be using cheap, Intel Core-I3 or I5 Desktops with little to no RAM.

For the student coverage app, i will be using tensor flow js face detection model, the pretrained one, to detect faces of students, and identify and count how many times a student appeared.

Keep in mind I have no idea what I'm doing, the fact I even got the model to work was a miracle for me.
